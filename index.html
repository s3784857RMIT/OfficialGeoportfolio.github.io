	<div class="about">
		Hello and welcome to my Geoportfolio. My name is Daniel McManus, a geospatial student who is an ethusiast in working with spatial data and understanding the complexities of the land that we sit on.
		My Geoportfolio includes information about myself and the projects that I have worked on that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science. 
		<p>
		I'm a 23 year old living in Melbourne, Australia and I am in my fourth and final year of the Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) (Honours) course at RMIT University.
		I have completed 2 years of both diploma and advanced diploma of surveying, which contributed to the additional 3 years of geospatial science. The programs provided me with a strong foundation in geospatial technologies and data analysis. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Additionally, my years of experience in the field as a surveyor assistant have further enhanced my practical understanding of spatial data and its applications.
		With a rich background in surveying and geospatial science, I've delved into the intricate world of GIS tools, mastering applications like ArcGIS and QGIS. 
		</p> 
		<p>
		My passion lies in transforming spatial data into meaningful narratives, using my keen eye for detail and problem-solving skills.
		I enjoy creating accurate spatial maps, working with satellite and aerial imagery, learning about geoscience, human geography, cartography and mapping.

	<div class="academic-intro">
		During my time in the Cartography course at RMIT University, I honed my professional map-making skills, empowering me to craft compelling maps from diverse spatial data sources. 
		This immersive class involved working with spatial data from online government resources and population figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). 
		The course emphasised applying cartographic design theory in practical contexts, challenging my abilities to create convincing maps. 
		The final mapping assignment served as a testament to my acquired cartographic skills, 
		showcasing both my practical expertise and theoretical knowledge in the realm of map design.
		<p>

	<div class="academic-intro">
		<p>
			In my Environmental Systems Analysis class at RMIT University, I delved into the intricate world of GIS, 
			aiming to bridge the gap between urban development and ecological preservation.	
		</p>
		</p>
		The challenge was to propose land use management strategies through an academic poster. Urbanisation, with sprawling roads and buildings, often fractures habitats critical for biodiversity. 
		Using GIS, I identified key areas for ecological connectivity, proposing innovative solutions. Land bridges and carefully designed tunnels emerged as practical interventions, tailored to the needs of diverse fauna. 
		Additionally, my research emphasised the vital role of collaboration between government bodies and private landowners. 
		<p>
		Through pretend education initiatives and strategic partnerships, I advocated for the preservation of cultural sites and wildlife habitats. 
		This GIS-driven approach not only highlighted the problem but also presented viable, implementable solutions, underscoring the importance of a harmonious balance between human development and nature in our ever-expanding cities.

	<div class="academic-intro">
		<p>
			In my Spatial/Geographical Information Science Analytics class, I undertook a pivotal assignment as a Geospatial Analyst for the Cardinia Shire Council. 
			Tasked with assessing the accessibility of schools in Pakenham, a fast-growing Victoria suburb, my objective was to ensure an equitable distribution of schools relative to residential areas. 
			Employing GIS tools, I meticulously analysed road networks, mesh block data, and school locations, meticulously calculating walking distances. 
			The analysis revealed three prominent routes falling outside the acceptable 40-minute walking radius, indicating gaps in educational accessibility
		</p>
		<p>
			Utilising ArcMap, I implemented closest-facility analysis, categorising routes based on walking times. 
			Despite challenges with outdated data, I successfully proposed two strategic school locations bridging accessibility gaps, facilitating better education access for the community. 
			This project not only honed my GIS skills but also showcased my ability to address real-world challenges using spatial analysis. 
			Through this assignment, I learned the practical application of geospatial data in enhancing social infrastructure, a valuable lesson I carry forward into my geospatial career endeavors.

		During my initial work experience with JAC Surveyors, which commenced as 160 hours internship and later transitioned into a full-time casual role spanning from September 2019 to May 2022, 
		I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the intricate world of geospatial science. 
		Working mainly during university holidays, 
		I engaged in substantial projects, notably Oherns Road and Donnybrook Road, where I played a pivotal role as a surveyor assistant.
		<p>
			My responsibilities extended to rigorous analysis of field data, contributing significantly to the production of precise reports for various projects. 
			One of the key projects, Oherns Road, involved daily monitoring of targets on a developed bridge. 
			This task demanded collecting precise spatial data related to the bridgeâ€™s deformation, movement, and structural changes. 
			Using tools like LisCAD and Pix4DMapper whenever I used drone flight footage, I meticulously compared current data with baseline figures, detecting any deviations over time. 
			This process ensured the dataâ€™s high quality, minimising errors and inconsistencies.
			</p>
		<p>
			This hands-on experience equipped me with valuable skills in spatial data analysis, enabling me to translate intricate data into targeted and informative reports. 
			My role as a surveyor assistant at JAC Surveyors profoundly influenced my understanding of geospatial practices, shaping my expertise and enhancing my capabilities in the field.
